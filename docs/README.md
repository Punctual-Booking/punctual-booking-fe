# Project Overview

This is a booking application for service-based businesses (like salons, barbers, etc.) with three main user roles: Admin, Staff, and User (customers). The application is built with React, TypeScript, and uses several modern libraries including:

- React Router for navigation
- Zustand for state management
- i18next for internationalization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Radix UI components
- React Hook Form for form handling
- date-fns for date manipulation

# Application Structure

The application has a clear separation between admin and user interfaces:

## User Flow

1. Users can browse services (ServicesPage)
2. Select a staff member (StaffSelectionPage)
3. Choose a date and time for booking (BookingPage)
4. Confirm booking details (ConfirmationPage)
5. Receive booking confirmation (BookingSuccessPage)
6. View their bookings in a dashboard (CustomerDashboard)

## Admin Flow

The admin side includes management of:

- Dashboard overview
- Services management
- Staff management
- Customer management
- Bookings management
- Settings

# State Management

The application uses Zustand for state management with several stores:

- useBookingStore: Manages booking data and booking flow state
- useServiceStore: Manages service data
- useStaffStore: Manages staff member data
- useSettingsStore: Manages application settings
- useAuthStore: Manages authentication state

# Data Models

The application has well-defined TypeScript interfaces for:

- Bookings
- Services
- Staff members
- Customers
- Users and authentication

# Current Implementation

The booking page you shared shows a calendar for date selection and time slots for time selection. The page checks if a service and staff member have been selected before allowing the user to proceed.
The application is using mock data for now, with simulated API calls that return after a delay, suggesting it's in development and will eventually connect to a backend API.
The code is well-structured, follows modern React practices with functional components and hooks, and includes internationalization support for multiple languages.
